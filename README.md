## About the repository

This repository contains various statistical tasks and analyses implemented in tasks Jupyter notebook, aimed at providing practical examples of commonly used statistical methods.

The project Jupyter notebook performs an analysis on the
PlantGrowth dataset from R.

## Contents

**1. Tasks Jupyter Notebook**

This notebook contains a series of statistical tasks and exercises that demonstrate core concepts in applied statistics:

- **Permutations and Combinations:** Explore combinatorial methods used in statistics.

- **NumPy's Normal Distribution:** Learn about normal distribution and how to simulate it using NumPy.

- **t-Test Calculation:** Perform a t-test for hypothesis testing on sample data.

- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** Conduct an ANOVA test to compare the means of different groups.


**2. Project Jupyter Notebook**

This notebook demonstrates how to load and analyze the PlantGrowth dataset from R. The analysis involves exploring the relationship between plant growth in different treatment groups. It covers:

- t-test anlysis to determine the difference between the two treatment groups trt1 and trt2.
- Performing ANOVA to determine difference between the three treatment groups ctrl, trt1, and trt2.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebooks, you will need to set up your environment. This repository can be run using Python, Anaconda, and Visual Studio Code.

## How to run the Notebooks

To quickly run the notebooks on your local machine, follow these steps:

**1. Clone the repository:**

````bash
git clone https://github.com/PCM11/applied-statistics
````

**2. Download Anaconda:**

Download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) to create a virtual environment with the necessary dependencies. This ensures compatibility with the required packages.

**3. Visual Studio Code:**

Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and open the folder containing the repository.

- Open the Jupyter notebook files and run the cells.

**4. Requirements:**

This repository includes a requirements.txt file, which contains all the necessary Python packages. To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The requirements.txt includes the following packages:

- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter
- scipy
- statsmodel

**5. Google Colab:**
